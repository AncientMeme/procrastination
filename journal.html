                    After my drawing I didnt really like yesterday I revisited some old portrait 
                    sketches i had and found one that was vaugely sketched out so I did some more 
                    detailing and I think I like how he turned out a bit more.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was also able to use pencils and unfortunaly my erasor kept smuding but it ended up having an okay effect.
                    I hate lips tho I really wish it was okay to just draw face masks in every picture.

                    There is definitely improvement from the image you did yesterday! 
                    The shading effect looks good, but as you said it was smuding.
                    A more deliberate control of shading would make the art work even better. 
                    As for lips, it's one of the harder parts to draw, 
                    don't get discouraged and try out different approach to see what you prefer.

                    I think you got the flow of the hair shown really well, 
                    it looks like it has actual volume and weight which is hard to pull off. 
                    I also like how the earings are dynamic rather that straight down
